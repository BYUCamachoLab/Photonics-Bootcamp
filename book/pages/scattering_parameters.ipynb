We'll run through the steps using gdsfactory's default 2x2 mmi, and explain on the way how the principles can be applied to any component. "

    "For our simulation, it makes life easy if we add all of our sources and detectors into our gds before we import it into meep. For this tutorial I have already done this. For your simulations, you can modify your gds file directly in Klayout if you like a GUI, or you can use gdsfactory itself. If you like, you can also use meep to do the same thing, but I won't be showing how to do that here. \n",

    "I've added a box around the entire component (in purple) which will become the simulation region, and 8 lines, 2 on each end that will become the sources and detectors. I also added straight waveguides on the ports of the gdsfactory mmi so that my ports could be exactly where the light would enter and exit the component is an actual circuit. My sources are then slightly outside the mmi, in the waveguides.\n",
