    "## What are scattering parameters?\n",
    "\n",
    "For a given photonic device, while knowing the actual shape of the device is useful, what we really care about is how light propagates through it. Scattering parameters (S-parameters) are complex numbers that represent the magnitude and phase multiplier acting on the light between every port in a device. S-parameters are collected into an s-matrix which then represents the complete 1st order (linear) input-output response of the device.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a device with N ports, there will be N<sup>2</sup> parameters. The notation for S-Matrices is S<sub>(output port)(input port)</sub>, so S<sub>13</sub> will be for the light entering port 3 and exiting port 1. Parameters with the input and output port represent reflections from the device back into the same port, while different output and input ports represent the transmission from the input port into the output ports.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is easiest to represent s-parameters in polar coordinate form.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Example\n",
    "\n",
    "A device has the s-parameter $S_{21} = 0.98 e^{j\\frac{\\pi}{2}}$. This means the light accumulates $90^\\circ$ of phase, and its intensity/power will be 96% ($0.98^2 = 0.9604$) of the input when we measure the output on port 2 and put input light in port 1.\n",

    "In this section we'll demonstrate how to find the s-params for any device using a meep simulation. We'll show both 2D and 3D simulations, but keep in mind that 2D s-params are not very accurate, but the simulations run much faster. It is often recommended to set up the simulation in 2D to ensure everything works, then extend the simulation into 3D to run the final simulations. This can save us a lot of debugging time since the 2D simulations run faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll run through the steps using gdsfactory's default 2x2 mmi, and explain on the way how the principles can be applied to any component. There are other ways to find s-parameters, one such method is shown on the [Gds To Meep](/pages/gds_to_meep) page."

The function sim.get_eigenmode_coefficients() returns an array that holds the parameters for every mode, every frequency, and in the forward and backward direction. In our simulation we only simulated the fundamental TE mode and at only our center frequency. For most applications, only the fundamental TE mode matters, but often we do want to see how the S-parameters change with frequency. To do that, simply change the df and nfreq parameters for the mode monitors. However, in our simulation we do care about the direction. In our simulation, light will go in port 1 going forward (towards positive X) and exit ports 3 and 4 in the same direction, but any light exiting port 1 and 2 will be going backwards (towards negative X). Therefore, we retrieve the index [0,0,1] for port 1 and 2 which is the index for backward propagating mode."
