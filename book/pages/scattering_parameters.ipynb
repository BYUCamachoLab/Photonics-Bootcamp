    "\n",
    "Scattering parameters (S-parameters) are values that represent linear characteristics of devices that operate at radio frequencies or higher and are used in both RF electronics and in photonics. For a given photonic device, while knowing the actual shape of the device is useful, what we really care about is how light propagates through it. S-Parameters give us this necessary information by telling us how much light will exit a given port based on how much light was inserted and where. \n",
    "\n",
    "For a device with N ports, there will be N<sup>2</sup> s-parameters, which are normally organized in an NxN matrix, ofen called the Scatter Matrix. Each S-parameter is a complex number that gives the magnitude and phase of the wave exiting the exit port given the wave entering the input port. The notation for S-Parameters is S<sub>(output port)(input port)</sub>. So, S<sub>13</sub> will be for the light entering port 3 and exiting port 1\n",

    "Scattering parameters allow us to characterize the bechavior of photonic circuits in a comprehensive way.

They allow us to understand how various elements within a photonic circuit interact. \n",

    "For our simulation, it makes life easy if we add all of our sources and detectors into our gds before we import it into meep. For this tutorial I have already done this. For your simulations, you can modify your gds file directly in Klayout if you like a GUI, or you can use gdsfactory itself. If you like, you can also use meep to do the same thing, but I won't be showing how to do that here. This tutorial is adapted from the [GDSII Import](https://meep.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Python_Tutorials/GDSII_Import/) tutorial on the meep documentation\n",

In our simulation we only simulated the fundamental TE mode and at only our center frequency. For most applications, only the fundamental TE mode matters, but often we do want to see how the S-parameters change with frequency. To do that, simply change the df and nfreq parameters for the mode monitors. However, in our simulation we do care about the direction. In our simulation, light will go in port 1 going forward (towards positive X) and exit ports 3 and 4 in the same direction, but any light exiting port 1 and 2 will be going backwards (towards negative X). So, we change the alpha to be (0,0,1) for port 1 and 2. The 1 in the third spot indicates the backward propagating light. We'll also see how much light is inserted at port 1 going forward."
