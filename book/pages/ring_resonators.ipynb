        "A ring resonator is a waveguide loop with one or two waveguides next to it in a directional coupler configuration. Light enters the ring via directional coupling from one of the waveguides, also called an access waveguide or a bus. Single and double bus designs are the most common, corresponding to the number of coupler waveguides next to the ring. As we learned in the directional coupler section, the amount of light coupled into the ring depends on the gap between the bus and the ring waveguides, and the effective coupling length.\n",

        "Imagine a scenario where we turn on a laser input to a ring resonator. As light couples into the ring, it will go around until it arrives back at the coupling point. At the start of the 2nd round trip, the light in the ring interferes with the light coming from the bus waveguide. When the interference of the waves is constructive, the intensity of light in the ring increases for the next round trip until the round trip propagation loss is equal to input power from the coupler waveguide. When the constructive interference is perfect, we say that the ring is in resonance. Resonance significantly increases the intensity of the electric field in the ring. The wavelengths which interfere destructively in the ring instead couple back into the bus waveguide, and the intensity of the electric field is low in the ring for those wavelengths.\n",

        "Let's build up some of ring resonators' behavior mathematically. First, we want to find how far the light has to travel around the ring, which is the \"effective circumference\" of the resonator. This can be approximated by drawing a line through the resonator's waveguide center around the ring, and finding its length. For a perfect circle resonator, this is given by\n",
        "\n",
        "$L = 2\\pi r$.\n",
        "\n",
        "While the light is propagating in the resonator, some of the light scatters out due to the bending of the waveguide. This is referred to as propagation loss or bend loss (since the waveguide is bent). We write it as $A$ and calculate it using\n",
        "\n",
        "$A = e^{-\\alpha L}$\n",
        "\n",
        "where  $\\alpha$ is the waveguide propagation loss, commonly in units of $(cm^{-1})$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, we'll want to find how much power goes in and out of a ring resonator. To do this, we find the ratio of the electric field at both the input and the output ports. This ratio will tell you if more light is going into the ring or out of it. The two electric fields are:\n",

        "\n",
        "Remembering that $\\beta = \\frac{2 \\pi n}{\\lambda}$ is the propagation constant, we can then define the Ring Resonator Transfer Function as the ratio of the output and input electric fields squared. Substituting the above two formulas finally gives us the transfer function of the ring resonator.\n",

Saturation state is also called the steady-state operation of a ring resonator which is established after the input light has made many round trips around the resonator. Note that non-resonant wavelengths can also be in saturation, they will just have much smaller intensity at saturation than resonant wavelengths.\n",

        "\n",
        "A critically coupled resonator is also in saturation. Intuitively explained, the phase of the light incoming from the ring is just right to completely destructively interfere with the light in the input bus waveguide, causing all the light to couple into the resonator.\n",
        "\n",
        "Under these conditions, $|t| = e^{-\\alpha L/2}$ and $e^{j \\beta L} = 0$, so when we substitute into the transfer function above we get\n",

        "\n",
        "The Free Spectral Range (FSR) of a resonator is the distance between resonant wavelengths, i.e. the peak-to-peak distance on a spectral response plot for a ring resonator.\n",

        "\n",

Q factors are more commonly used than FWHM when comparing resonators because it is a unitless quantity that doesn't scale with the operating wavelength of the resonator (NOTE: Q factors DO change with respect to wavelength due to dispersion, but it includes wavelength scaling: e.g. a FWHM of 10nm at 1500nm gives a Q of 150, while 10nm at 2000nm gives a Q of 200)."
