[KLayout](https://www.klayout.de/) is a free and open-source software for layout design and verification. It's most basic use case is as a layout viewer (it can read and display GDS files, the most common format for laying out photonic chips), but it is a powerful tool for designing photonic devices and integrated circuits as well. It has features for {term}`DRC`, viewing chip cross-sections, tracing nets (to help you detect shorts), and more, while also being scriptable in several languages including Ruby and Python. KLayout is available for Windows, Mac, and Linux. You can download KLayout [here](https://www.klayout.de/build.html).
