    "This course is built with software that is known as \"open-source software.\" But\n",
    "what does open source really mean, and what are you legally allowed to do with\n",
    "it? This is a particularly important question if you work at a company that is\n",
    "writing software to distribute to customers, because depending on the license,\n",
    "any code that incorporates it may inherit the requirement to also be \n",
    "open-source.\n",
    "\n",
    "Free and open source software (FOSS) is software where the source code is\n",
    "freely availble to be read by end users or other developers. The open source\n",
    "portion refers to the fact that anyone is allowed to inspect, modify, and/or\n",
    "enhance the code--it refers more to the design methodology or methods of\n",
    "collaboration in the creation of the software. It enables many people of\n",
    "different skills or backgrounds to collaborate on a software, often outside of\n",
    "the context of a company. While often monetarily free itself (perhaps under\n",
    "certain conditions or use restrictions), the \"free\" part of FOSS refers to the\n",
    "freedom to use the software in any way you wish as an end user; it means that\n",
    "you have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the\n",
    "software.\n",
    "\n",
    "One advantage of open source software is that you can look under the hood to\n",
    "see what's actually going on. You can extend it for your own specific needs,\n",
    "there's a strong open source community focused on making more software more\n",
    "accessible to more people. However, one potential downside is that it's often\n",
    "thanklessly maintained by a few dedicated programmers spending their free time\n",
    "on it. Some companies allow their engineers to spend a portion of their time\n",
    "contributing to open source software. Some of the software in this course, for\n",
    "example, is driven by engineers at Google, PsiQuantum, and other companies.\n",
    "Because of its nature of being community driven, depending on the size of the\n",
    "project, maintenance and bug fixes can be slower than a commercial software.\n",
    "On the other hand, the community is free to submit fixes to the original \n",
    "software, meaning that depending on the size of the project and the number of\n",
    "users it garners, it can actually become a very actively developed software.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of these software projects are more \"friendly\" to coporate environments\n",
    "based on their licensing scheme; before incorporating any of these into your\n",
    "code, you'll definitely want to confirm with your company's legal team the\n",
    "ability to utilize existing open source software, especially if you're rolling\n",
    "it into another software that you plan to release to customers. We'll introduce\n",
    "a couple of the most commonly seen open source licenses below.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Licenses\n",
    "\n",
    "### MIT License\n",
    "\n",
    "The MIT license is a very permissive license and is extremely short (only 162 \n",
    "words). It carries with it two requirements; in your own copy of the code\n",
    "(whether you modified it or not), you must include {cite:p}`mitlicense`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The original copyright notice  \n",
    "1. A copy of the license itself  \n",
    "\n",
    "The MIT License does not require those who modify the original code to also\n",
    "release it under the MIT or other open-source license. In other words, your\n",
    "version remains proprietary, if you so wish. You can incorporate MIT licensed\n",
    "code into commercial software, modify it, and use a different (perhaps\n",
    "stricter) license for the derived work. As mentioned in the license text, \n",
    "however \"the software is 'as is', without warranty\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Of the licenses mentioned here, this is the most commonly encountered  in the\n",
    "open source software world.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Apache 2.0 License\n",
    "\n",
    "The Apache 2.0 License is also a permissive license, carrying few restrictions.\n",
    "The requirements when incorporating modified or original code licensed under\n",
    "this license are that you must include {cite:p}`apachelicense`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The original copyright notice  \n",
    "1. A copy of the license itself  \n",
    "1. If applicable, a statement of any significant changes made to the original code  \n",
    "1. A copy of the NOTICE file with attribution notes (if the original library has one)  \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the MIT license, code licensed under the Apache 2.0 license can be\n",
    "rereleased under a different license. Where it differs is in the explicit \n",
    "grant of patent rights to contributors or users of the code. That means you can\n",
    "claim a patent on the portion of contributions you make to the original \n",
    "codebase.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the MIT licesnse, you cannot hold contributors legally liable for any\n",
    "reason. You're also not granted any rights to the trademarks of the licensor.\n",
    "Of the open source licenses, this is potentially the most permissive.\n",
    "\n",
    "### GPLv3+/AGPL License\n",
    "\n",
    "These belong to a class of licenses known as \"copyleft licenses\", and they\n",
    "mandate that distributed works based on any existing copyleft-licensed\n",
    "components must use the same license as the original. In other words, a\n",
    "derivative work of GPL v3-licensed software must also be licensed under the GPL\n",
    "v3.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is typically unpopular with companies, and many corporate environments\n",
    "(especially software companies) will prohibit the use or inclusion of any \n",
    "software under this license to prevent any potential \"contamination\" of their\n",
    "code witih this license, which would technically require them to open-source \n",
    "the offending software or open them to legal liability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users of GPLv3 code are required to {cite:p}`gpllicense`:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Include a copy of the full license text  \n",
    "1. State all significant changes made to the original software  \n",
    "1. Make available the original source code when you distribute any binaries\n",
    "   based on the licensed work  \n",
    "1. Include a copy of the original copyright notice  \n",
    "\n",
    "The GPL license and others like it attempt to force a \"pay-it-forward\" attitude\n",
    "when it comes to open source software. While not necessarily a downside---many\n",
    "impressive projects use the GPL license (the GNU project, Notepad++, Wordpress,\n",
    "and MySQL, to name a few)---because it would force a company to open source \n",
    "their code (and therefore be unable to control its sale), it's less popular.\n",
