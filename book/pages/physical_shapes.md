# Physical Shapes
There are several different shapes that we can manufacture. Keep reading through this tutorial to learn more about these different shapes:  
- [Multimode Interferometers (MMIs)](/pages/mmis)  
- [Mach-Zehnder Interferometers (MZIs)](/pages/mzi)  
- [Directional Couplers](/pages/directional_couplers)  
- [Y Branches](/pages/y_branch)  
- [Ring Resonators](/pages/ring_resonators)
