# Passive components
Using the shapes that we made in the [physical shapes](/pages/physical_shapes) section, we can now make different passive components. We will walk through the design of these components: 

- [Directional Couplers](/pages/directional_couplers)  
- [Y Branches](/pages/y_branch)  
- [Ring Resonators](/pages/ring_resonators)  
- [Multimode Interferometers (MMIs)](/pages/mmis)
