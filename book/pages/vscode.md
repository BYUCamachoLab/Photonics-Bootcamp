# Visual Studio Code

While you can write computer code using any text editor, some text editors have
special features that make writing code easier.  In this course, we will be
using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) (also known as
vscode), a popular open-source text editor by Microsoft that is desiged
specifically for writing code. It boasts a healthy set of extensions that 
can provide integrated development environment (IDE)-like capabilities in a 
much lighter program.
