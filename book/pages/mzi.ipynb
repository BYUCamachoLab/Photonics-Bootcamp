    "An interferometer is just an instrument that utilizes the difference interfecence of two beams of light to make precise measurements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Mach-Zehnder Interferometer (MZI) splits a light beam, sends the light down two different paths and recombines the light. We say that the MZI is balanced if the two paths are the same distance or unblanced if the path lengths differ."

    "\n",
    "One implementation of this concept is illustrated above. Notice that the inner path of the MZI is shorter than the outer path, therefore the MZI is unbalanced. This implies that the two light beams will be out of phase with each other when they are recombined and interference occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the interference that occurs when the light is recombined is dependent on the the wavelength of the intitial beam of light, the amount of light that leaves the interferometer will be dependent on the initial wavelength."
