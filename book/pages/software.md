# Software

In the following sections, we'll describe the various software packages used
in this course and how to configure them on your local machine.

The course can be completed on any modern operating system (OS); we'll provide
setup instructions for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Some of the open-source
packages we'll describe, however, are only compatible with Mac and Linux.
Therefore, on Windows, you'll have to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) in
order to complete the course. 

Through this setup guide, we're going to be very opinionated about which 
software to install and how to configure your system. This is for the benefit
of the newcomer; one standard setup that we'll describe and know how to
troubleshoot. If you're experienced enough to disagree with our setup method,
we assume you're also experienced enough to adapt all our instructions to your
own way of doing things. 

## Windows

We recommend installing Ubuntu through the Microsoft Store, which will give you
a terminal interface on your local machine (although we will primarily use
Visual Studio Code to interact with it, providing a GUI-like experience, so
you don't need to be too nervous about having to navigate a terminal).
