# Software

In the following sections, we'll describe the various software packages used
in this course and how to configure them on your local machine.

The course can be completed on any modern operating system (OS); we'll provide
setup instructions for Windows, MacOS, and Linux. Some of the open-source
packages we'll describe, however, are only compatible with Mac and Linux.
Therefore, on Windows, you'll have to use Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) in
order to complete the course. 

## Windows

We recommend installing Ubuntu through the Microsoft Store, which will give you
a terminal interface on your local machine (although we will primarily use
Visual Studio Code to interact with it, providing a GUI-like experience).
