    "For our simulation, it makes life easy if we add all of our sources and detectors into our gds before we import it into meep. For this tutorial I have already done this. For your simulations, you can modify your gds file directly in Klayout if you like a GUI, or you can use gdsfactory itself. If you like, you can also use meep to do the same thing, but I won't be showing how to do that here. \n",

My sources are then slightly outside the mmi, in the waveguides.\n",
