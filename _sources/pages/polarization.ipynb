    "In addition to moving down the waveguide, the electric and magentic components of the wave are oscillating perpendicular to each other. The direction in which this oscillation occurs is where the idea of polarization of light comes from. The polarization of light simply refers to the direction in which the electric componet oscillates. In this case, the electric component of the wave moves vertically in the Y-direction, so we say that the wave is vertically polarized."

    "This presents a challenged when considering that light typically is not polarized. Unpolarized light is composed of waves of light whose magnetic field components are arranged in random directions. And since the components of light polarized in the X and Y directions is not predictable, the behavior of the unpolarized light is not completely consistent in a waveguide."
