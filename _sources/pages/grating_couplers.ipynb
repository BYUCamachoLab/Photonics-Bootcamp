The alternating refractive indices create interference patterns in the light which result in a propogating wave. The patterns of diffraction are described by the Hyugen's Fresnel principle and Bragg's law."

    "The grating period (typically denoted by \"ÊŒ\") is the parameter most likely to effect the efficiency of a grating coupler. It is the length of one period of the grating, and is measured in microns. The grating period is typically chosen to be near half the wavelength of the light being used. This is because the bragg grating period is related to the wavelength of light by the equation:\n",

    "\n",
    "If we were to choose this period to be exactly half the wavelength, the light would be diffracted at 90 degrees, which is problematic since a byproduct of this diffraction would be a large amount of light reflected back into the waveguide. This is known as the \"zeroth order\" diffraction. To avoid this, the grating period is typically chosen to be slightly less than half the wavelength of the light. This results in a diffraction angle slightly less than 90 degrees, which is ideal for coupling light into a fiber optic cable.\n",
