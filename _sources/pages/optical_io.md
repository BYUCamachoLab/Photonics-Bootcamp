# Optical I/O

Using the shapes that we made in the [physical shapes](/pages/physical_shapes) section, we can now make different passive components. We will walk through the design of these components: 

* [Grating couplers](grating_couplers)
* [Edge couplers](edge_couplers)
  
To skip the explanation of these shapes and to go onto the simulation step click [here](/pages/digital_shape_representation)
