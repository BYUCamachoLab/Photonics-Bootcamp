They are used to either split light into two waveguides or to combine light from two waveguides into one. While y-branches can be created that split light into any arbitrary fraction, in this page we will focus on a 50/50 y-branch. \n",

Thus, in a 50/50 splitter, the actual outputs will be slightly less than 50, but should still be equal if we ignore manufacturing variability. There are y-branches that are designed to split light in different ratios, e.g. 70/30, 90/10, and those have different shapes.\n",

The light in the outputs also looks different from the light in the input because the light is now split between the fundamental mode (like the input) and higher order modes. The part of the light in higher order modes is often just considered \"lost\" since many photonic circuits assume that all the light is in the fundamental mode.\n"

        "Recombining light with y-branches is more complicated than one might expect based on intuition. The behavior of electromagnetic fields in linear optical media is symmetric in time, which means that if we change the outputs to be inputs and vice-versa, then we get the exact same response. Therefore, in order to get perfect combination of light into the fundamental mode, we need to have both branches on the right side to have input light with the same phase. Then the light from the two branches constructively interferes and all the light ends up in the fundamental mode.\n",

        "When you input light from only one branch, some of the light couples into the fundamental mode (0th order) and some into the 1st order mode, and some back-reflections into the second input branch. If you look at this from the time reversal perspective, if the y-branch is a 50-50 splitter, you can't just have light in the fundamental mode coming from the input if you want the light to all go into a single output branch because the y-branch will split the light 50-50. However, if you introduce a higher order mode, you can now create interference that ensures most of the light goes into a single output. Which output that is is determined by the relative phase of the two modes.\n",
