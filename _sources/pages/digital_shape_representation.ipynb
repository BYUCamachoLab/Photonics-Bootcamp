    "A [multi-mode interferometer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi_mode_interferometer) is used to split or combine light waves. There are different shapes of MMIs. A 1x2 MMI for example takes one wave as an input and splits it into two outputs. Ideally the power between the outputs would be a 50-50 split but this is nearly impossible."
