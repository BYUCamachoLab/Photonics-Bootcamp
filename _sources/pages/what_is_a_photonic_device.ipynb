    "# What is a Photonic Device?\n",
    "\n",
    "Photonic devices are an analogue to electronic devices but instead of manipulating electricity, a photonic device manipulates light in a specified, useful way. Photonic devices are the building blocks of a photonic circuit. Devices can be created on the macro or micro scale, although it is increasingly common for photonic devices to refer to microscale structures. \n",

    "### Active vs Passive Devices\n",
    "\n",
    "Photonic devices can be either active or passive. Active devices require an input of energy and often output power to a circuit, while passive devices only consume power. Examples of active photonic devices include lasers, photodiodes, and LEDs. Passive devices include waveguides or other components that guide the light.\n",

    "### Manufacturing of Devices\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like in electronics, photonic devices can be manufactured in a variety of ways. Photolithography can be used for silicon-on-insulator platforms (discussed in the following page)\n",
