    "# Multimode Interferometers (MMIs)\n",
    "\n",
    "MMIs are devices that are used to combine and split light in a predictable way. They are designed not only to output a certain fraction of the input power, but are also designed so that the outputs have a certain phase difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic design of an MMI includes the multimode region (a.k.a the body of the MMI) which is a multimode waveguide. To support more than three modes and be considered \"multimode\", the waveguide is wider than a single mode waveguide. Tapers to gradually widen the input and output waveguides as they go in and out of this multimode region are also common. MMIs are denoted by the number of input and output ports they have, with an NxM MMI having N input ports and M output ports.\n",

    "## Self-Imaging\n",
    "\n",
    "The function of an MMI is based of of self-imaging. An \"image\" is a place where the electric fields are replicas of the electric field of the input. They occur periodically in MMIs at a distance called the beat length, determined by the equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$L_{\\pi} = \\pi / (\\beta _0 - \\beta _1)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The images are created from light reflecting off of the walls of the multimode region and interfering constructively or destructively with other reflections. This self-imaging is how MMIs are able to combine and split light. For example, if you wanted a 2x2 MMI that splits light from one input port into another, you would find the length at which there are two images present in the MMI, and put the output ports there.\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-imaging can work in this \"forwards\" way to split light and it can also work \"backwards\" to combine light. In other words, if you wanted to combine light with an MMI instead of split it, you could excite waves going into the output ports, and get a combined image of them at an input port based on the same principle of imaging."
